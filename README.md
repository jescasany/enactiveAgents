# enactiveAgents

This is a Python implementation of Enactivist Cognitive Architecture, following materials present on [Developmental AI MOOC](http://liris.cnrs.fr/ideal/mooc/).

Help on running the simulation is available by typing:

```python simulate.py --help```

The simulation allows for choosing between test and real world environments, as well as 3 cognitive mechanisms: simple, recursive and constructive. To run e.g. recursive learning algorithm in a real environment, type

```python simulate.py recursive real```
